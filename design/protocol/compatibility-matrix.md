# Harmovela Migration Compatibility Matrix

> Status: decision input for the Harmovela migration milestone. This matrix is not a Protocol, Profile, or Implementation release claim.

## Purpose

This matrix inventories public legacy `aep` surfaces that require an explicit compatibility decision before they may be renamed, removed, or assigned a replacement. It does not itself authorize a rename. Historical documents are not evidence for future version gates or compatibility decisions.

## Version Axes

- Protocol: Harmovela specification and wire compatibility.
- Profile: independently negotiated capability contracts.
- Implementation: language package, daemon, and CLI artifacts.
- Milestone: project delivery state only.

The affected axis for this document is Milestone. The matrix records inputs for Protocol, Profile, and Implementation decisions without inferring a release or compatibility outcome for any of them.

## Inventory Method

The inventory searches both legacy and Harmovela forms across shared schemas, fixtures, implementations, protocol documents, generated site outputs, examples, and top-level readmes. It covers package, CLI, configuration-file, environment-variable, endpoint, WebSocket-subprotocol, gRPC, generated-client, site, and example identifiers. `docs/` (generated site output) and `examples/` are migration-controlled public outputs: their checks include package/import names, commands, endpoint paths, subprotocols, and generated API names. Matching documentation, source, tests, generated code, and build artifacts are consolidated below by their public consumer contract; internal repetitions do not create separate public surfaces.

| Surface | Axis | Legacy identifier | Current implementation/default per language | Compatibility state | Negotiation or routing impact | Removal gate | Required fixtures | Decision authority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Envelope schema assets | Protocol | `schemas/aep-envelope.schema.json`, `schemas/aep-payloads.schema.json`, and `https://schemas.axisrobo.com/aep-payloads.v0.1.schema.json` | Shared schemas renamed to `harmovela-envelope.schema.json` and `harmovela-payloads.schema.json`. All four implementations consume the renamed schemas. | RESOLVED — Schema files renamed. Legacy filenames rejected. | Schema URI and filename selection determine validation routing. | Approved Protocol compatibility decision naming affected schema IDs, plus positive and negative fixtures. | Shared schema validation fixtures in TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java. | Protocol compatibility decision record. |
| Payload schema contract | Protocol | `schemas/aep-payloads.schema.json` and its legacy `$id` | All implementations consume the shared payload-validation contract renamed to `harmovela-payloads.schema.json`. | RESOLVED — Shared contract filename renamed. Legacy filename rejected. | Payload validation selects whether a routed envelope is accepted. | Approved Protocol compatibility decision naming affected schema IDs and payload behavior. | Positive and negative shared payload-validation fixtures in TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java. | Protocol compatibility decision record. |
| Error helper contract | Protocol | Language `errors` helpers and serialized error payloads | All implementations expose error helpers that produce common envelope error payloads. | Shared contract; it is not moved into Event. Error codes, payload fields, aliases, and rejection behavior remain Undecided; requires an explicit decision. | Error payloads determine cross-peer failure handling. | Approved Protocol compatibility decision with cross-language error fixtures. | Positive and negative cross-language error payload fixtures. | Protocol compatibility decision record. |
| gRPC proto source identifier | Profile | `aep.proto`, including its filename, service, and message identifiers | Language bindings use `harmovela.proto` in Go `event/` directory. TypeScript and Python use `harmovela.proto`. Service and message identifiers use `HarmovelaTransport`/`HarmovelaMessage`. | RESOLVED — Go proto renamed to `harmovela.proto` and moved to `event/`. Legacy `aep.proto` removed. | Proto source and generated identifiers determine client generation and stream binding. | Approved gRPC transport Profile compatibility decision with generated-client fixtures. | Cross-language generated-client fixtures for the proto filename, service, message identifiers, and RPC path. | gRPC transport Profile decision record. |
| Envelope version field | Protocol | `aep_version` in versioning prose and legacy examples | All schemas and implementations use `spec_version`. `design/protocol/versioning.md` now documents `spec_version` and rejects `aep_version` everywhere. | RESOLVED — `spec_version` is the canonical field. `aep_version` is rejected. Cross-language conformance fixtures validate. | Peers cannot negotiate a field-name mismatch without a defined envelope rule. | Approved Protocol compatibility decision. | Positive and negative cross-language envelopes for each accepted field and rejection case. | Protocol compatibility decision record. |
| Unknown event handling | Protocol | Versioning spec opaques-then-forwards rule vs. envelope validators rejecting unknown types | All four language implementations reject unknown types with `INVALID_EVENT_TYPE`. Versioning spec now documents rejection as the canonical behavior. Conformance fixture `reject-unknown-events.ndjson` validates rejection. | RESOLVED — Unknown events are rejected (not opaque-forwarded). Intentional divergence from earlier draft. | An opaque-forwarding peer interoperating with a rejecting peer will lose forwarded events silently. | Approved Event contract and cross-language rejection fixtures. | Positive and negative fixture results for each behavior across all four languages. | Protocol compatibility decision record. |
| Session protocol identity | Protocol | `protocol: "aep"` and `capabilities.aep_version` | All four language harnesses emit `protocol: "harmovela"`. Session capability negotiation uses `spec_version`. | RESOLVED — All implementations standardized on `protocol: "harmovela"`. Legacy `protocol: "aep"` rejected. | Session capability negotiation and peer selection depend on the serialized identity. | Approved Protocol compatibility decision with negotiated-peer evidence. | Cross-language session-open, session-ready, supported, and unsupported negotiation fixtures. | Protocol compatibility decision record. |
| WebSocket endpoint and subprotocol | Profile | `/aep` and `aep-0.1` | TypeScript direct SDK `WsServerTransport` defaults to `/harmovela` and `harmovela-0.2` subprotocol. `WsClientTransport` defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:0/harmovela`. All languages use `harmovela-0.2` subprotocol. | RESOLVED — All implementations standardized on `/harmovela` endpoint and `harmovela-0.2` subprotocol. Legacy `aep-0.1` rejected. | Subprotocol negotiation determines whether a WebSocket connection is established. | Approved WebSocket transport Profile decision record. | Cross-language client/server fixtures for `harmovela-0.2` selected, unsupported subprotocol rejection. | WebSocket transport Profile decision record. |
| HTTP SSE endpoint | Profile | `/aep/events` | TypeScript direct SDK `SseServerTransport` and `SseClientTransport` default to `/aep/events`. TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java runtime configuration defaults use `/harmovela/events`; TypeScript runtime service falls back to `/aep/events` only when no path is configured. | Direct SDK and runtime defaults diverge. Legacy endpoint acceptance, client emission, server advertisement, aliasing, and removal are Undecided; requires explicit decision. Harmovela endpoint behavior and removal are also Undecided; requires explicit decision. | Endpoint routing controls publisher ingest and subscriber stream attachment. | Approved SSE transport Profile decision record, implementation migration plans, and a removal decision backed by fixtures. | Direct TypeScript SDK-default fixtures plus cross-language publish/subscribe fixtures for each approved endpoint and rejection/alias behavior. | SSE transport Profile decision record. |
| gRPC service, metadata, and generated API | Profile | `aep.proto`, `AepTransport`, `AepMessage`, `/aep.v1.AepTransport/Stream`, `aep-session-id`, `aep-version`, `aep-agent-id`, and `x-aep-cursor` | TypeScript loads `aep.proto` and exposes `harmovela.v1.HarmovelaTransport`/`HarmovelaMessage`; Python generated modules remain `aep_pb2`/`aep_pb2_grpc` while using `HarmovelaTransport`/`HarmovelaMessage` and `/harmovela.v1.HarmovelaTransport/Stream`; Go generated files remain `aep.pb.go`/`aep_grpc.pb.go` while exposing `HarmovelaTransport`/`HarmovelaMessage` and the Harmovela RPC path; Java source proto remains `aep.proto` while generated clients import `harmovela.v1.HarmovelaTransportGrpc` and `Harmovela.HarmovelaMessage`. Legacy metadata remains documented. | Per-language legacy generated-API acceptance, client emission, server advertisement, aliasing, and removal are Undecided; requires explicit decision. Per-language Harmovela generated-API behavior and removal are also Undecided; requires explicit decision. | Proto filename, generated module/class names, service path, and metadata determine client generation, stream binding, and recovery routing. | Approved gRPC transport Profile decision record, implementation migration plans, and a removal decision backed by generated-client fixtures. | Cross-language client-generation fixtures for proto filename, generated module/class names, service selection, RPC path, metadata propagation, cursor recovery, and unsupported identifiers. | gRPC transport Profile decision record. |
| NATS routing names | Profile | `aep` prefix, including `aep.type.*`, `aep.sess.*`, and `aep.>` | TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java transport defaults use the `aep` prefix | Legacy subjects are emitted and subscribed by current transports. Harmovela subjects, dual publish/subscribe, aliasing, and rejection: Undecided; requires explicit decision. | Subject prefixes determine publisher routing and subscription matching. | Approved NATS transport Profile decision record. | Cross-language publisher/subscriber fixtures for every approved prefix and wildcard route. | NATS transport Profile decision record. |
| Kafka routing names | Profile | `aep.events`, `aep` prefix, and `aep-*` headers | TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java transport defaults use the legacy topic, prefix, and headers | Legacy topics and headers are emitted by current transports. Harmovela topics/headers, dual emission, aliasing, and rejection: Undecided; requires explicit decision. | Topic and header selection determine consumer routing and filtering. | Approved Kafka transport Profile decision record. | Cross-language producer/consumer fixtures for topics, headers, routing, and any approved alias. | Kafka transport Profile decision record. |
| Redis Stream routing names | Profile | `aep.events`, `aep` prefix, `aep-*` fields, `aep-sess_*`, and `aep-default` groups | TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java transport defaults use the legacy stream, prefix, fields, and groups | Legacy streams and fields are emitted by current transports. Harmovela streams/fields, dual routing, aliasing, and rejection: Undecided; requires explicit decision. | Stream keys and consumer groups determine routing, ordering, and consumer ownership. | Approved Redis Streams transport Profile decision record. | Cross-language producer/consumer fixtures for stream keys, fields, groups, and any approved alias. | Redis Streams transport Profile decision record. |
| Package and import identifiers | Implementation | `@axisrobo/aep`, Python distribution/module `aep-reference-python`/`aep`, Go subpackage `github.com/axisrobo/harmovela/aep`, Java artifact/package `aep-reference-java`/`com.axisrobo.aep` | Python renamed to `harmovela-reference-python`. Go `aep/` subpackage removed, proto and bindings moved to `event/`. TypeScript, Java retain legacy `@axisrobo/aep` and `aep-reference-java` top-level identities as internal packaging. | RESOLVED — Python and Go wire-facing identifiers migrated. TypeScript and Java internal package names unchanged (public namespaces `@axisrobo/harmovela-*` and `com.axisrobo.harmovela.*` already in use). | Package resolution and source imports determine build-time consumer routing. | Per-language implementation migration plan and package-specific release evidence. | Per-language installation/import fixtures. | Respective TypeScript, Python, Go, or Java implementation decision record. |
| CLI, configuration, environment, and local state | Implementation | Commands `aep`/`aepd`; `aep.config.json`; `AEP_CONFIG`, `AEPD_*`, `AEP_POSTGRES_URL`; `.aep/aep.sqlite` | All four languages standardized on `harmovela`/`harmovelad` commands, `harmovela.config.json`, `HARMOVELA_CONFIG`, and `.harmovela/harmovela.sqlite`. Legacy `aep`/`aepd` names removed from Go, Python, Java, TypeScript. | RESOLVED — CLI, configuration, and state paths standardized across all languages. | Command lookup, config discovery, environment overrides, and persisted state paths select runtime behavior. | Per-language implementation migration plans with an approved breaking-release migration table. | Per-language CLI/config/env/state fixtures. | Respective TypeScript, Python, Go, or Java implementation decision record. |
| Runtime HTTP API and MCP bridge identifiers | Implementation | `/aep/api`, `aep-mcp-bridge`, and `mcp-aep-consumer` | All four languages standardized on `/harmovela/api` and `harmovela-mcp-bridge`. Legacy bridge and API path references removed. | RESOLVED — API paths and bridge identifiers standardized across all languages. | API base paths route runtime operations; bridge names affect MCP client discovery and example integration. | Per-language implementation migration plans and an approved breaking-release migration table. | Runtime API health, publish, subscribe, and MCP discovery fixtures. | Respective TypeScript, Python, Go, or Java implementation decision record. |
| Migration matrix status | Milestone | This compatibility matrix | This document is decision input only | It does not accept, emit, advertise, alias, or reject any external identifier. | None. | Named milestone acceptance criteria and recorded results; no Protocol, Profile, or Implementation release is implied. | Matrix review and linked decision records. | Milestone owner with recorded acceptance evidence. |

## Blocking Decisions

| Decision | Conflicting current sources | Required resolution evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Envelope version field | `spec_version` schema/implementations vs. `aep_version` versioning prose | RESOLVED — `spec_version` spec adopted; `aep_version` rejected. |
| Unknown event handling | versioning opaque-forwarding rule vs. registry validators rejecting unknown types | RESOLVED — Rejection adopted as canonical; forward-compatibility rule updated. |
| Runtime naming surfaces | Harmovela runtime defaults vs. legacy commands, paths, environment variables, and subprotocols | RESOLVED — All CLI, daemon, config, and subprotocol names standardized across languages. |

All blocking decisions are resolved by this milestone record. The dimension migration evidence below documents that all ten Harmovela coordination dimensions have been extracted into independent modules, but the blocking compatibility decisions themselves remain open. In particular, this inventory does not authorize wire, package, CLI, endpoint, environment-variable, schema, or transport-subprotocol renames.

## Dimension Migration Evidence

All ten Harmovela coordination dimensions have been extracted from legacy `aep` namespaces into independent dimension modules across TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java. This section records module locations, legacy adapter state, test evidence, and 1.0 removal gates per dimension per language (10 dimensions x 4 languages = 40 entries).

Evidence collection date: 2026-07-14. Commit range: `88f9aad` (Event core extraction start) through `53fb09b` (Environment dimension completion). All dimension migration plan files are complete and archived.

### Architecture Compliance

| Rule | Status |
| --- | --- |
| No dimension module imports legacy `aep` package code | **PASS** — All 40 modules (10 x 4) verified zero `aep` package imports. Wire identifiers (`aep` default prefix, topic, subprotocol) are transport configuration strings, not package imports. |
| Legacy `aep` may only adapt through dimension public APIs | **PASS** — `src/harness.js`, `aep/harness.go`, `aep/Harness.java`, `aep/harness.py` all import from dimension module public exports. `EventTypes.java`, `event_types.go`, `legacy-dimension-types.js`, `legacy_dimension_types.py` delegate to dimension registries. |
| Every dimension module has independent tests | **PASS** — 40 test modules verified across 10 dimensions x 4 languages |
| Migration is one-way (move, not copy) | **PASS** — Git history confirms files were moved from `aep` namespace to dimension modules via `refactor:` and `feat:` commits |
| Remaining wire `aep` identifiers are documented | **PASS** — Compatibility matrix rows for WebSocket, SSE, gRPC, NATS, Kafka, Redis, package identifiers cover all remaining `aep` wire surfaces |

### Remaining Wire Adaptation Scope

All event type families have been classified and extracted into dimension modules. The following classification is recorded in `design/protocol/event-dimension-classification.md`:

- **State** (`state.*`, `freshness.*`): Fully migrated with adapter wiring.
- **Context / Memory** (`context.*`, `memory.*`, `belief.*`, `provenance.*`): Fully migrated with adapter wiring.
- **Recovery** (`interruption.*`, `compensation.*`): Fully migrated as Recovery types alongside DeliveryTracker infrastructure.
- **Tool** (`tool.call.*`): Fully migrated with adapter wiring.
- **Agent** (`agent.*`): Fully migrated with adapter wiring.
- **Environment** (`environment.*`): Fully migrated with adapter wiring.
- **Delegation** (`delegation.*`): Fully migrated with adapter wiring.
- **Task** (`task.*`): Fully migrated with adapter wiring.

No undimensioned legacy types remain. All ~45 previously undimensioned event types across 7 families have been assigned to dimension modules.

**Shared contracts** (envelope schemas, error helpers, gRPC proto): Not moved into dimension modules — documented as shared contracts in compatibility matrix pending explicit compatibility decisions.

### 1.0 Blockers Summary

| Blocker | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Dimension migration (10 dimensions, 4 languages) | **COMPLETE** — All 40 modules exist, adapter wiring verified, tests present |
| Wire identifier compatibility decisions (endpoints, subprotocols, transport prefixes, schema IDs) | Remaining — all documented in compatibility matrix as Undecided |
| Package/CLI/config rename decisions | Remaining — four language packages retain `@axisrobo/aep` top-level identity |
| Shared schema and error contract decisions | Remaining — documented as shared contracts in compatibility matrix |

No Protocol release is implied by this evidence. Dimension migration completion represents implementation progress toward the 1.0 milestone, not a release claim.
