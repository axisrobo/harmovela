# Event Type Dimension Classification

Classification of legacy undimensioned event types into Harmovela coordination dimensions.

## Classification Summary

| Event Type Family | Dimension | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `state.*`, `freshness.*` | State | In `State` module; spread into legacy registries |
| `belief.*`, `provenance.*` | Context / Memory | In `Context` module (cognitive facts and attestations); spread into legacy registries |
| `context.*`, `memory.*` | Context / Memory | Already in `Context` module |
| `delegation.*` | Delegation | Already in `Delegation` module |
| `interruption.*`, `compensation.*` | Recovery | In `Recovery` module; spread into legacy registries |
| `task.*` | Task | Already in `Task` module; may benefit from future spreading |
| `tool.call.*` | Tool | In `Tool` module; spread into legacy registries |
| `command.*` | Command | In `Command` module |
| `query.*` | Query | In `Query` module |
| `agent.*` | Agent | In `Agent` module; spread into legacy registries |
| `environment.*` | Environment | In `Environment` module; spread into legacy registries |

## Rationale

**State dimension** (`state.*`, `freshness.*`): Covers current known truth, snapshots, deltas, invalidation, and temporal freshness windows. The `State` module owns these.

**Context / Memory dimension** (`belief.*`, `provenance.*`): Covers cognitive decisions (belief revision, conflict detection) and provenance attestation chains. The `Context` module owns these alongside existing `context.*` and `memory.*` types.

**Recovery dimension** (`interruption.*`, `compensation.*`): Interruption lifecycle and compensation semantics belong to the Resilience/Recovery dimension. The `Recovery` module owns these and they are spread into legacy registries.

**Tool dimension** (`tool.call.*`): Covers tool invocation lifecycle (MCP bridge). The `Tool` module owns these and they are spread into legacy registries.

**Agent dimension** (`agent.*`): Covers agent-to-agent messaging, request/response creation, and decision recording. The `Agent` module owns these and they are spread into legacy registries.

**Environment dimension** (`environment.*`): Covers environment observation, change detection, alerting, and error reporting. The `Environment` module owns these and they are spread into legacy registries.
